	In General we are having no of companies producing processors.
	
	In code we taken SnapDragon and MediaTek both implement processors so taken MobileProcessor as Interface.
	SnapDragon and MediaTek are the child class to MobileProcessor.

	we are using 
	@Autowired -which connect to particular object.
	@Qualifier("snapDragon") -It takes the object automatically using class name.
	
	AppConfig is used to configure the application
	@Configuration
	@ComponentScan(basePackages="com.swamy.SpringAnno")-It scan the component from the package
	
	SnapDragon and MediaTek both implement processors
	@Component
	
	ApplicationContext factory=new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);
	We can get content by using BeanFactory and ApplicationContext both use for same purpose.
	
	BeanFactory can handle less data support
	
	ApplicationContext can handle the real application data support
